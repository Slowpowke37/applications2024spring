Bike Research

Personal - I rode a bike when I was younger and have not done much in recent years aside from every now and then. I remember we used to buy bikes at Walmart or sometimes a local used sports store. We would normally get Trek or Giant bikes and when I got a bit older I would get 5 or 7 speed gears.
