Summary: 
Some elements that felt universal were the use of the shopping cart icon, some sort of description specifications area, a filter of varying complexity, and radio buttons used for customization. On the laptop page there were button related animations when the customer would add or change a part to the laptop. The design languages were fairly distinct with each of the stores we visited leaning into their respective markets. Overall, the sites were intuitive and at some points fun to explore the different capabilities. My highlight was the interactive pricing and animations that came along with laptop customization.
